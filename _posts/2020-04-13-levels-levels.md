If you're reading this, it means my first blog-style post successfully went up to Nonstandard Deviations! Great work.

This blog runs on what I consider to be an especially elegant stack of software.

- The domain name is provided by [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)[^6466] for about $15/year.
- The source code used to build the site itself is hosted [here on Github](https://github.com/AndrewQuinn2020/Nonstandard-Deviations).
- Every time I push a commit, CDN provider [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) takes the new source code and runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the actual HTML, CSS, and JS files that get sent to you, o Internet nomad. Then they host a copy of those files and serve it to you, at no cost to me!

**End cost**: \$15/year, compared to WordPress's \$fuck-you/year, and I have personal copies of all the software and code that make this blog tick available to me for as long as I care to hold onto it. [Long Site design](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site) is a good principle to uphold even if the content itself is not worth much.

Here's some testing of our MathJax rendering.

 $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

 $$\frac{\delta x}{\delta y} = xy$$
