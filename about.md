Hi there, my name's Andrew. Pleasure to meet you. ðŸ™‚ 25 years old, he/him/his, reformed Internet shitposter and aspiring mild-mannered goofball Midwestern dad.

My various social media presences are linked in the footer. I'm most active these days on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AQuinn2020), but feel free to email me as well. I used to post a bit on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/aaq) and related sites, so if you see `aaq` that's probably me.

# Education

As of April 2020, at the beginning of [The Great Sick](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic&oldid=950049281), I am a student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I actually almost didn't bother coming here,

Prior to transferring there, I was a student at [Bunker Hill Community College](https://www.bhcc.edu/), and prior to *that* I was a student of [Boston Latin School](https://www.bls.org/). (Class of 2012/2013 represent!)

# Interests and Hobbies

My favorite hobbies are messing around with computers and [reading blogs on the Internet](http://www.thewestologist.com/ideas/when-life-imitates-art). I also really like movies, music, video games, and most other staples of garden-variety nerd life. I am, however, sort of drifting away from cyberspace's more ephemeral pursuits as I get older; memes are grand, but they just don't stick around long enough to justify investing in them.
